# Hardware
### CPU
* Brain of the computer
* Communicate heavily with RAM
* Register: Store the data that CPU works with

### RAM - Randomly Accessed Memory
* Short term memory
* Volatile, once you close your PC, it disappears.

### ROM
* Non volatile
* Store BIOS (Modern BIOS => UEFI)
* BIOS = low-level software that
    - helps initialize computer's hardware in our PC and get our OS up and running
    - run a process called POST (Power On Self Test) to run diagnotic test to make sure the computer is in proper working order

### CMOS battery
* basic BIOS data about booting your PC (date, time, how you want to start)

### Cache
* Smaller than RAM, but it allow us to store data that we use often
* Almost the same with RAM
* Like the stuff in our pockets vs food in fridge (RAM)
* L1, L2, L3 => L1 is the smallest and fastest

### MCC - Memory Controller Chip
* Connect (aka the bridge) RAM and CPU
* MCC will grab the data from RAM and send it to CPU
* RAM => MCC => CPU

### Hard drive
* Long term memory
* HDD VS SSD
* HDD: Cheaper, but a lot of moving parts, prone to damage
* SDD: Expensive, but faster

### Motherboard
* Circuit board that hold everything together
* Components: chipsets, expansion slot, form factor (aka the shape and layout of the motherboard)
* Chipsets: Decide how components talk to each other on machine
* [Reference](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/motherboard1.htm)

### EDB (External Data Bus)
* Kind of like a veins in our body (Maybe like the nerves?)
* Transport binary data
* Sending a voltage through the wire = 1
* No voltage = 0
* 8, 16, 32, 64 wires
* 8 bits = 1 byte

### Address Bus
* Transport memory address
* MCC => Address Bus => CPU

### Clock Wire
* Internal clock that keeps its operational in sync
* When user send/receive data, he sends a voltage to the clock wire to let the CPU know it can start doing calculation
* Clock speed: Maximum amount of clock cycle that it can handle in a certain period of times
* eg. 3.4 GigaHertz = 3.4 billion cycles per second
* Overclocking: Potentially overheat the CPU/uses more power but also make it significantly faster than what it should be

### Peripheral
* External devices that we connect to the PC, eg. Mouse, keyboard, monitor

# Operating System (OS)
### SSH (Secure Shell)
* Not a remote server but just a software that constantly checking whether there is client connect to it
* Public Key VS Private Key
    - A set of keys that can only perform either unlock or lock. eg. Public key can only lock but cannot unlock

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
* More sophiscated SSH with a lot more setup
* Allow us to connect to a private network over the internet

### Components
* Kernel (Communicating with the hardware, user don't communicate with it)
    - Process Manager (Allocate the resources to run the process)
    - Memory Manager
        - We don't load all the data to RAM at once, but to store it in Virtual Memory (allocated space = swap space)
        - We only load the part of the data that is currently running to RAM
    - File Manager (Windows: NTFS => REFS; Mac: APFS, Linux: ext4)
    - I/O Manager
        - Maintain input and output
        - load up driver
        - handle communication between the devices
    - User Space (The part that user communicate with)
        - Everything that Outside of Kernel

### Boot Process
* Power On => BIOS/UEFI (Including POST) => Boot Device (Bootloader) => OS => Kernel (System Processes + User Space)

### Examples:
* Windows
* Mac OS
* Linux
    - Debian
    - Ubuntu
    - Red Hat
* Android OS
* Chrome OS

# Networking
### Unicast VS Multicast VS Broadcast
- Done by looking at the special bit (i.e. first octet of a destination addr) in the destination MAC Address
- Example:
    - Unicast: For just one receiving address
    - Multicast: For >1 receiving address
    - Broadcast: To every instances in the LAN Network
